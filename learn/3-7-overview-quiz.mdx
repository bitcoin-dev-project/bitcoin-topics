## Ex 2: Locking and Unlocking

Letâ€™s see how well you understand the core concepts of locking and unlocking scripts, which are key to securing and spending Bitcoin transactions.

        {
            question: "What is another name for a Locking Script?",
            options: ["ScriptSig", "Witness", "ScriptPubKey", "OP_CHECKSIG"],
            correctAnswer: "ScriptPubKey",
            explanation:

                "They are not executed during validation"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Unlocking Script first, then Locking Script",
            explanation:
                "The Unlocking Script is executed first, and its result is then passed to the Locking Script. If the Locking Script is satisfied, the transaction is considered valid."
        },
        {

            ],
            correctAnswer:
                "The transaction is discarded and not added to the blockchain",
            explanation:
                "If the Unlocking Script does not satisfy the Locking Script, the transaction is considered invalid and is not added to the blockchain."
        },
        {

                "It can include cryptographic operations like OP_CHECKSIG"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "It is also known as a ScriptSig",
            explanation:
                "The Locking Script is not known as a ScriptSig; that term refers to the Unlocking Script. The Locking Script is known as a ScriptPubKey."

## Ex 4: Script Success and Failure

This quiz will test your understanding of what makes a Bitcoin script valid or invalid, focusing on the conditions that lead to script success or failure.

<Quiz
    questions={[

            correctAnswer: "The final value left on top of the stack",
            explanation:
                "After the script executes, the success or failure is determined by the final value on top of the stack. A non-zero value signifies success, while zero indicates failure."
