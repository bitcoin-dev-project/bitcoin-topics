In p2pk, bitcoins are sent to a public key,
The recipient must provide a valid signature to spend it

*Despite being the simplest script for locking bitcoins to someone's public key, P2PK is not used as much as the similar P2PKH script
## How does it work:



The ability to lock and unlock coins is the mechanism by which we transfer bitcoin. _Locking_ is giving some bitcoins to some entity. 
_Unlocking_ is spending some bitcoins that you have received.

#### 1- Locking (ScriptPubKey):
When creating a P2PK transaction, the sender specifies the recipient's public key in the ScriptPubKey.
**ScriptPubKey**: A pay-to-public-key locking script looks like this:
```
<recipient's public key> OP_CHECKSIG
```

 This script specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the bitcoins in the future.
 and it's Placed within the output of a transaction.
 
#### 2- Unlocking (ScriptSig)

To spend Bitcoin sent to a P2PK address, the recipient must provide a valid signature corresponding to the public key. 
**ScriptSig:** would look like this:
```
<signature>
```

#### 3- Validation

When a transaction is validated, the ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey are concatenated.
```
<signature> <recipient's public key> OP_CHECKSIG
```


> [!NOTE]
> OP_CHECK SIG

 
## Script Validation:
The combined script is executed using stack operations.

### Examples:
For a hands-on example, we can look at some of the very early Bitcoin transactions, many of which were P2PK. One notable transaction is from block 170 (**irst Bitcoin transaction in history**), which includes a payment from Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney. 
###### Example Details:

- **Transaction ID**: 0d6fe5213c0b3297bde922a8045c10c85b9a749bdaab8940446851b97ef6f484
- **Block**: 170
- **Date**: January 12, 2009


### Problems with P2PK
### P2PK Challenges: Quick Overview

| **Issue**             | **Explanation**                                   | **Impact**                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Key Length**        | Public keys are 65 bytes (130 hex characters).    | Difficult to handle, not user-friendly.    |
| **Storage Demands**   | Uncompressed keys increase blockchain size.       | Reduces node scalability.                  |
| **Security Exposure** | Public keys are visible, risking future breaches. | Potential future risks if ECDSA is broken. |
| **Block Space**       | Uses more block space than necessary.             | Inefficient use of valuable space.         |

### P2PKH Advantages
Transitioning to P2PKH mitigates these issues by using hashed addresses, which are:
- **Shorter**: Reduced to 20 bytes from public keys.
- **More Secure**: Public key remains hidden until the coins are spent.
- **Space Efficient**: Optimizes block space usage.

### Example Transition
**Old P2PK Address Style**:
- Public key (130 hex characters): `04b0bd634234abbb1ba1e986e884185c
