bitcoin scripts are simple programs written in a language called Script or bitcoin Script. These scripts define the conditions under which bitcoin can be spent or transferred.

Key features of bitcoin Script include:

1. **Stack-based**: Operates using a stack data structure, similar to the Forth programming language from the 1960s.
2. **Turing incomplete**: Cannot create infinite loops, preventing potential denial-of-service attacks.
3. **Stateless**: Each script contains all necessary information for validation, requiring no external data.
