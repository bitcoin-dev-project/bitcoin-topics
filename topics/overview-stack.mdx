A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Think of it like a stack of plates:

-   You add (push) new plates to the top.
-   You remove (pop) plates from the top.

Let's visualize this with our Bitcoin Stack component.  
Try pushing some values onto the stack and see how they stack up!

<StackSimulator showOperations={false} />

### 2. Basic Stack Operations

Bitcoin's script uses stack operations to process data. Let's explore two operations as an example:

`OP_ADD`: pops the top two values from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back.

1. Push the number 3 onto the stack
2. Push the number 4 onto the stack
3. Click the `OP_ADD` button

<StackSimulator showOperations={true} />

`OP_EQUAL`: compares the top two stack items. If they're equal, it pushes `1` (true), otherwise `0` (false).

1. Push the number 5 twice
2. Click the `OP_EQUAL` button

<StackSimulator showOperations={true} />

Now try with different numbers!
