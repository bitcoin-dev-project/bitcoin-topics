In bitcoin's scripting language, several opcodes are used to push data onto the stack:

1. **OP_0 to OP_16**: Push numbers 0 to 16 onto the stack.

2. **OP_PUSHBYTES[1-75]**: Push 1 to 75 bytes onto the stack. The number in the opcode name indicates how many bytes to push.

3. **OP_PUSHDATA1, OP_PUSHDATA2, OP_PUSHDATA4**: Push a specific number of bytes onto the stack. The number following the opcode specifies how many bytes of the subsequent data should be pushed.

4. **OP_1NEGATE**: Pushes the number -1 onto the stack.

    The maximum amount of data that can be pushed in a single operation is **520
    bytes**.

    Value-pushing opcodes are often omitted in discussions about bitcoin scripts
    because these discussions typically focus on the logical operations or
    conditions that scripts perform, such as verifying signatures or checking
    conditions for spending. These opcodes are straightforward and mainly
    involve pushing data onto the stack, which is not as interesting or complex
    as the logical operations performed by other opcodes.
