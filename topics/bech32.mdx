## Introduction

Bech32 is an address format for SegWit (Segregated Witness) addresses. It is designed to be more efficient, secure, and user-friendly compared to traditional address formats.

## How Bech32 Works

Bech32 addresses use a base32 encoding, which is more compact and error-resistant than base58. They start with a human-readable part, followed by '1', and a data part representing the witness version and program.

## Benefits of Bech32

- **Lower Fees**: More efficient encoding reduces transaction size and fees.
- **Error Detection**: Improved error detection makes addresses more resilient to typos.
- **SegWit Compatibility**: Fully compatible with SegWit, enhancing transaction efficiency and security.

## Example Bech32 Address Creation

Here's an example of creating a Bech32 address using BitcoinJS:

```js
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');

// Create a Bech32 (SegWit) address
const keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();
const { address } = bitcoin.payments.p2wpkh({ pubkey: keyPair.publicKey });

console.log(`Bech32 Address: ${address}`);
