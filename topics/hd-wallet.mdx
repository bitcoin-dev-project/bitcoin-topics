## Introduction

Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets are a type of Bitcoin wallet that allows the generation of multiple addresses from a single seed phrase. This enhances security and simplifies wallet management.

## How HD Wallets Work

HD Wallets use a single seed phrase to generate a tree of private keys. Each key can derive multiple child keys, allowing for an organized and hierarchical structure of addresses. This is defined in BIP 32.

## Benefits of HD Wallets

- **Enhanced Security**: The seed phrase can be used to recover the entire wallet, ensuring funds are not lost if the wallet is compromised.
- **Simplified Backup**: Only one seed phrase needs to be backed up to secure all derived addresses.
- **Organized Management**: Different accounts and addresses can be managed under a single wallet structure.

## Example HD Wallet Creation

Here's an example of creating an HD Wallet using BitcoinJS:

```js
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');

// Generate a seed phrase
const seed = bitcoin.bip39.mnemonicToSeedSync('praise you muffin lion enable neck grocery crumble super myself license ghost');
const root = bitcoin.bip32.fromSeed(seed);

// Generate the first address from the HD wallet
const account = root.derivePath("m/44'/0'/0'/0");
const { address } = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({ pubkey: account.publicKey });

console.log(`HD Wallet Address: ${address}`);
