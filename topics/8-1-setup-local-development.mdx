To get started on this project, we've prepared a starter repository with some code for you.

The project source code exists on GitHub, at the following URL: https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/bitcoin-stack

If you're familiar with Git, you can fork this project and clone it onto your own computer.  
If you're not familiar with Git, you can download a .zip file containing everything you need:

<div className="relative w-full h-[400px] mb-32">
    <Image
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/project-bitcoin-stack/repo-download.svg"
        alt="Purple toaster"
        layout="fill"
        objectFit="cover"
        className="rounded-lg"
    />
</div>

To run a local development server, we first need to install third-party dependencies (eg. React, bitcoin-js). This can be done by cd-ing into the root project folder and running the following command:

<CodeSnippet
    code={` 
  $ npm install

`}
language="shell"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>

Once the dependencies have been downloaded, you can run a dev server with the following command:

<CodeSnippet
    code={` 
  $ npm run dev
  
`}
    language="shell"
    showLineNumbers={false}
/>

This will start a local development server. The terminal output should look something like this:

<div className="flex justify-center my-4">
    <div className="w-3/4 relative">
        <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black opacity-5 filter blur-sm rounded-lg"></div>
        <Image
            src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/project-bitcoin-stack/terminal.png"
            alt="Purple toaster"
            width={1200}
            height={675}
            layout="responsive"
            className="rounded-lg relative z-10 shadow-lg"
        />
    </div>
</div>

After downloading the project repository and starting a development server (npm run dev), you should see the following initial page:

<div className="relative w-full aspect-[16/9] mb-16 mt-4">
    <Image
        src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/project-bitcoin-stack/bitcoin-stack-app.png"
        alt="Bitcoin Stack App initial page"
        layout="fill"
        objectFit="contain"
        className="rounded-lg"
    />
</div>
