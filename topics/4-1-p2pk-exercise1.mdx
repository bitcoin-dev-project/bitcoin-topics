In this exercise, we'll be looking at the ScriptPubKey from the transaction in [block 170](https://mempool.space/tx/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16), where Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney.

### Your Task

Your task is to identify the different components of the P2PK ScriptPubKey in its hexadecimal representation.

\*_Use the interactive highlighter below to select the correct parts of the script when prompted._

    fields={[
        { name: "OP_PUSHBYTES_65", start: 0, end: 2 },
        { name: "OP_CHECKSIG", start: 132, end: 134 },
        { name: "Public Key", start: 2, end: 132 }
    ]}
/>

### Components to Identify:

1. **OP_PUSHBYTES_65**: This opcode indicates that the next 65 bytes should be pushed onto the stack.
2. **Public Key**: The actual public key (65 bytes in uncompressed format).
3. **OP_CHECKSIG**: The opcode that verifies the signature against the public key.

    title="Additional Hints"
    hints={[
        "Remember that in hexadecimal, each byte is represented by two characters.",
        "The public key takes up 65 bytes (130 hexadecimal characters).",
        "The public key starts immediately after OP_PUSHBYTES_65 and is 130 characters long in hex.",
        "OP_CHECKSIG is represented by 'ac' in hexadecimal and appears at the end of the script."
    ]}
/>

After completing this exercise, try to answer the following questions:

    questions={[
        {
            question:
                "What is the purpose of OP_PUSHBYTES_65 in a P2PK script?",
            options: [
                "To push the public key onto the stack",
                "To verify the signature",
                "To hash the public key"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "To push the public key onto the stack",
            explanation:
                "OP_PUSHBYTES_65 instructs the script to push the next 65 bytes (the public key) onto the stack."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is the public key 65 bytes long in this script?",
            options: [
                "It's a compressed public key",
                "It's an uncompressed public key",
                "It includes a checksum"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "It's an uncompressed public key",
            explanation:
                "Uncompressed public keys in Bitcoin are 65 bytes long, starting with 0x04 followed by the x and y coordinates (32 bytes each)."
        }
    ]}
/>

By completing this exercise, you'll gain a better understanding of how P2PK scripts are structured and how to interpret their hexadecimal representations.

This will be helpful as we explore more complex script types in future lessons.
