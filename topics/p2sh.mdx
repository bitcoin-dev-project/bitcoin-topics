## Introduction

Pay To Script Hash (P2SH) is a Bitcoin transaction type that allows the sender to commit funds to a script hash. The recipient must provide a script matching the hash and the necessary data to satisfy the script.

## How P2SH Works

In a P2SH transaction, the sender pays to the hash of a redeem script instead of a public key. The recipient must provide the redeem script and the required inputs to unlock the funds.

## Benefits of P2SH

- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Supports complex scripts, enabling functionalities like multi-signature and time-locked transactions.
- **Increased Privacy**: The redeem script is not revealed until it is used, providing privacy for the transaction structure.
- **Standardization**: Simplifies the creation of custom transaction types by abstracting script details.

## Example P2SH Transaction

Here's an example of creating a P2SH address and redeeming a P2SH transaction using BitcoinJS:

```js
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');

// Create a P2SH address
const redeemScript = bitcoin.script.compile([
  bitcoin.opcodes.OP_HASH160,
  Buffer.from('20-byte-hash-of-redeem-script', 'hex'),
  bitcoin.opcodes.OP_EQUAL
]);
const { address } = bitcoin.payments.p2sh({ redeem: { output: redeemScript } });

console.log(`P2SH Address: ${address}`);

// Redeem a P2SH transaction
const txb = new bitcoin.TransactionBuilder();
txb.addInput('txid', 0);
txb.addOutput('recipient-address', amount);
txb.sign(0, keyPair, redeemScript);

const tx = txb.build();
console.log(`Transaction: ${tx.toHex()}`);
