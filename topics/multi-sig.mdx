## Introduction

Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) wallets require multiple private keys to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. This adds an extra layer of security by distributing control across multiple parties.

## How Multi-Sig Works

A Multi-Sig wallet is created with a set of public keys and a defined number of signatures required to authorize a transaction. For example, a 2-of-3 Multi-Sig wallet requires 2 out of 3 private keys to sign a transaction.

## Benefits of Multi-Sig

- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of theft, as multiple keys are needed to access funds.
- **Shared Control**: Ideal for organizations where multiple approvals are required for transactions.
- **Backup Recovery**: Multiple key holders can recover funds if one key is lost.

## Implementing Multi-Sig

Here's a basic example of creating a Multi-Sig address using BitcoinJS:

```js
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');

// Generate 3 public keys
const keyPair1 = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();
const keyPair2 = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();
const keyPair3 = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();

const pubKeys = [keyPair1.publicKey, keyPair2.publicKey, keyPair3.publicKey];
const { address } = bitcoin.payments.p2ms({ m: 2, pubkeys: pubKeys });

console.log(`Multi-Sig Address: ${address}`);
