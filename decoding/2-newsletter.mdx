We summarize the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitcoin-dev</a>, <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lightning-dev</a> and <a href="https://delvingbitcoin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delving bitcoin</a> mailing lists.

Bitcoin-dev alone has **20,000+ posts** going back to June 2011. There is a problem though, **NOT EOUGH PEOPLE READ IT 🙁**

This newsletter is designed to help keep you up to date with the latest posts as well as surface active discussions from the past.

## What do the newsletters look like?

We summarize every post and then summarize the summaries so that every thread summary remains fresh based on the replies.
